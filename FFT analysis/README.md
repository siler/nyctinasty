Processing the spacial-temporal data into frequency-temporal knowledge isn't trivial.  Each Arch has 8 distance sensors.  Each Sepal has three arches.  Nyctinasty has three Sepals.

From this, we can understand that processing distance data into "coordination" information is non-trivial!

Files in this area are stand-alone (R) applications that are used to develop methods.  Those methods, once sound, get translated to the uC code elsewhere.
